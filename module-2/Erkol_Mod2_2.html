        <h1>Assignment 2.2 – Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>

        <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            I am married without children and enjoy building a stable and fulfilling life with my partner.
            We stay busy with our two husky sisters from the same litter, who are energetic, vocal, and always
            keep things interesting at home.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently working on a dual degree in cybersecurity and software development, with only seven
            months remaining until graduation. This journey has helped me build strong technical skills and a
            deeper understanding of how technology impacts modern organizations.
        </p>

        <p>
            I work as an asset protection manager, a role I truly enjoy because no two days are ever the same.
            The work is fast-paced, challenging, and rewarding, and it allows me to constantly learn and adapt.
            <span class="sentence">I enjoy problem-solving and staying alert in dynamic environments.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, woodworking in my garage, and gaming.
            These hobbies help me relax, stay creative, and maintain a healthy balance outside of work and school.
